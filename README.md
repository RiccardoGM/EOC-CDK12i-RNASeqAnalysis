# EOC-CDK12i-RNASeqAnalysis

**Overview**

This repository contains code and processed data to perform differential gene expression and alternative splicing from bulk RNA-sequencing experiments in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) models. The dataset covers multiple cellular conditions, including parental, platinum-resistant, and SR4835-resistant models, each analyzed under untreated, platinum-treated, and SR4835-treated conditions. The repository includes workflows for differential gene expression, gene set enrichment analysis for Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Process terms, and junction-based alternative splicing.

Genome annotation files are not included in the repository. Users should download a GENCODE comprehensive gene annotation [file](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_44.html) and place it in the genome_annotation folder before running the analyses.
